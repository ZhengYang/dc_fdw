  1 | BAHIA COCOA REVIEW                                               +
    |   Showers continued throughout the week in                       +
    |   the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early      +
    |   January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,       +
    |   although normal humidity levels have not been restored,        +
    |   Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.                    +
    |       The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.  +
    |       Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags  +
    |   of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93   +
    |   mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems   +
    |   that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the+
    |   arrivals figures.                                              +
    |       Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how  +
    |   much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has       +
    |   practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates    +
    |   around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there +
    |   are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, +
    |   middlemen, exporters and processors.                           +
    |       There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit +
    |   for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in     +
    |   obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.                       +
    |       In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have+
    |   sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.           +
    |       Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350  +
    |   cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.                               +
    |       Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and  +
    |   only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to  +
    |   1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.                     +
    |       New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with  +
    |   June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs  +
    |   under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs   +
    |   per tonne FOB.                                                 +
    |       Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at     +
    |   4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.                                   +
    |       April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July+
    |   at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at+
    |   2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and+
    |   2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.                +
    |       Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,     +
    |   Uruguay and open ports.                                        +
    |       Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for          +
    |   March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times +
    |   New York Dec for Oct/Dec.                                      +
    |       Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible   +
    |   currency areas.                                                +
    |       Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325+
    |   and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New  +
    |   York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York   +
    |   Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith  +
    |   said.                                                          +
    |       Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags +
    |   against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 +
    |   crop.                                                          +
    |       Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to+
    |   be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after     +
    |   carnival which ends midday on February 27.                     +
    |                                                                  +

  1675 | GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS                         +
       |   The ruling GATT Council deferred a                                   +
       |   decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a      +
       |   European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese              +
       |   agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.                     +
       |       David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs       +
       |   and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties         +
       |   would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of              +
       |   resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.       +
       |       The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect         +
       |   the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,       +
       |   officially known as semiconductors.                                  +
       |       The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by      +
       |   allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum         +
       |   prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.                   +
       |       The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave          +
       |   U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.           +
       |       Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,       +
       |   Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC      +
       |   complaint during the heated Council debate.                          +
       |       Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael       +
       |   Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were             +
       |   unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.        +
       |                                                                        +

  1960 | CREDITOR BANKS MAY BUY INTO SINGAPORE COFFEE FIRM                      +

       |   Singapore coffee trader &lt;Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd> are          +
       |   thinking of buying a controlling stake in the company                +
       |   themselves, a creditor bank official said.                           +
       |       Since last December the banks have been allowing the             +
       |   company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an        +
       |   overseas commodity company to make an offer for the firm.            +
       |       At least one company has expressed interest and                  +
       |   negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.                 +
       |       However, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the       +
       |   stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven        +
       |   mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking            +
       |   sources said.                                                        +

       |   Merchant Bankers Ltd (SIMBL), will work on the new proposal          +
       |   with the creditor banks, they said.                                  +
       |       Major holdings are likely to be held by the two largest          +
       |   creditor banks, Standard Chartered Bank &lt;STCH.L> and              +
       |   Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd &lt;OCBM.SI>, they added.           +
       |       Teck Hock owes over 100 mln Singapore dlrs and the creditor      +
       |   banks earlier this week agreed to let Teck Hock fufill               +
       |   profitable contracts to help balance earlier losses.                 +

  2998 | IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY                       +
       |   Japanese customers have bought nearly six                            +
       |   mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company       +
       |   (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and          +
       |   Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese        +
       |   traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.                   +
       |       NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese           +
       |   customers with different formulas. One company has bought            +
       |   800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of           +
       |   30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.              +
       |       Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and       +
       |   Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.                        +

       |       Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to            +
       |   reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot          +
       |   markets, oil traders said.                                           +
       |       Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder          +
       |   weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was       +
       |   below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.            +

       |       Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price       +
       |   but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a      +
       |   discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one      +

       |       The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the          +
       |   official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln             +
       |   barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in          +
       |   Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have          +
       |   been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the        +
       |   official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the        +

       |   foreign exchange accounts at the Bank of China, the official         +

       |       Previously only residents of Guangdong and Fujian provinces      +

       |       The paper also said the minimum for opening a fixed deposit      +

       |   minimum for a current account is 20 yuan equivalent.                 +
       |       The paper said depositors could now withdraw all or part of      +
       |   their account, subject to a branch's reserves, instead of only       +
       |   a fixed amount as previously.                                        +

       |       The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15            +
       |   billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously         +
       |   reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.           +
       |       For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a      +
       |   record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,       +
       |   the department said.                                                 +
       |       During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78             +

       |   rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.           +
       |       The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes         +

       |   dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose       +
       |   1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars        +

       |       Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct           +
       |   because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department      +
       |   said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18       +
       |   pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars        +
       |   and a nine pct decrease from Japan.                                  +
       |       On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs      +
       |   or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct      +
       |   or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.                          +
       |       Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because         +
       |   supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were             +

       |   An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool                              +
       |   Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker               +
       |   International Corp based on revised terms that allow the             +
       |   companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as         +
       |   required by the U.S. Justice Department.                             +
       |        Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of       +
       |   the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how         +
       |   much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on      +
       |   the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.                 +
       |       An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a           +
       |   funding limit.                                                       +
       |       The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2          +
       |   billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through           +
       |   earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed         +
       |   Justice Department consent decree that would have given the          +
       |   companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed             +
       |   business.                                                            +
       |       Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr           +
       |   lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the      +
       |   merger.                                                              +
       |       Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of           +
       |   Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised           +
       |   terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a       +
       |   buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous               +
       |   agreement had proposed a three-month period.                         +
       |       Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would      +
       |   consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month           +
       |   extension to complete the sale.                                      +
       |       He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic      +
       |   drilling bit business.                                               +
       |       The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to                +
       |   voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.                          +
       |       Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be               +
       |   completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost             +
       |   savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial        +
       |   cutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,        +
       |   the name the merged company will take.                               +
       |       Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies           +

       |   palm oil from new plantations in northern Sumatra and western        +

  5473 | ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION                          +
       |   &lt;Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique                             +
       |   among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global            +
       |   expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its           +
       |   yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.       +
       |       First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst         +
       |   Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is      +
       |   attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because         +
       |   ... they're going to have to build an international earnings         +
       |   base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic       +
       |   trust companies," Walsh said.                                        +
       |       Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's         +
       |   154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth          +
       |   this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company           +
       |   profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.                    +
       |       He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26       +
       |   pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.                                   +
       |       Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with          +
       |   assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated            +
       |   internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.             +
       |       Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when          +
       |   other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and            +
       |   loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.                     +
       |       The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened      +
       |   domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank        +
       |   operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,      +
       |   Cornelissen said.                                                    +
       |       Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and         +
       |   Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical       +
       |   Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset      +
       |   management, merchant and private banking companies.                  +
       |       "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of the      +
       |   Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would       +
       |   otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up."                    +
       |       Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct          +
       |   competition with major global financial institutions in              +
       |   activities such as international lending and stock brokerage,        +
       |   in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional      +
       |   trust activities such as asset management, private banking and       +
       |   advisory services.                                                   +
       |       He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations          +
       |   "before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory       +
       |   Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.                 +
       |       "The international market is so big and we have such a           +
       |   miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really           +
       |   limited only by our energy and our desire to find more               +
       |   business," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "we          +
       |   don't think the international markets are well-served."              +
       |       Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign          +
       |   investment interest in North America and increased Canadian          +
       |   investment abroad, Cornelissen said.                                 +
       |       Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid        +
       |   economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said             +
       |   Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion       +
       |   dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.                            +
       |       Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia         +
       |   will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of      +
       |   global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we had        +
       |   to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include       +
       |   offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also          +
       |   recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.              +
       |       The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing         +
       |   growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any      +
       |   acquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have our        +
       |   eyes wide open for the right opportunities."                         +
       |       Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the          +
       |   company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,      +
       |   Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well      +
       |   covered by hundreds of small regional banks.                         +
       |       "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,"          +
       |   said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will            +
       |   probably do something with in the next five years."                  +
       |       He said the company would continue to emphasize its home         +
       |   Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services            +
       |   analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.                   +
       |       Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,         +
       |   trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in       +
       |   one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition         +
       |   for Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.       +
       |                                                                        +
       |                                                                        +

  5792 | KOBE RUBBER EXCHANGE TO EXTEND TRADING HOURS                           +
       |   The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will                                +
       |   extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to      +
       |   use the exchange.                                                    +
       |       Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry          +
       |   approval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at          +
       |   1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at the       +
       |   new session the following day before the opening call starts at      +
       |   0930 local time, an Exchange official said.                          +
       |       Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producer         +
       |   price indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active after      +
       |   the end of the current final session here.                           +
       |       The introduction of the new session will enable                  +
       |   participants to trade overnight after taking account of              +
       |   Singapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who are         +
       |   designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume        +
       |   traded overnight to the new final session before the opening         +
       |   session starts next day, the official said.                          +
       |       But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which      +
       |   sets a fixed price at each session, the price of contracts           +
       |   traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth        +
       |   session, he added.                                                   +
       |       Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve      +
       |   the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures              +
       |   industry to expand and internationalise.                             +
       |       The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, which          +
       |   also trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans to         +
       |   introduce an extra session.                                          +
       |       TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day. Four          +
       |   sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions,         +
       |   but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time.           +
       |                                                                        +

       |   over 82 mln dlrs worth of Goodwood Park Hotel Ltd shares and         +
       |   loan stock certificates belonging to the company's chairman,         +
       |   Khoo Teck Puat, banking sources said.                                +
       |       Khoo is a major shareholder of the &lt;National Bank of Brunei   +
       |   Bhd> (NBB), which closed in November after the Brunei                +
       |   authorities alleged 90 pct of its loans of 1.3 billion Brunei        +
       |   dlrs had been extended to Khoo-related firms without                 +
       |   documentation or guarantee.                                          +
       |       The Goodwood securities are now held by the Commercial           +
       |   Affairs Investigation Department, the banking sources said. The      +
       |   department declined to comment.                                      +
       |       The government move is aimed at protecting Goodwood's            +
       |   minority shareholders and securing Goodwood deposits at the          +
       |   NBB, the banking sources said.                                       +
       |       Goodwood had a total of 87.3 mln dlrs in fixed deposits,         +
       |   bank balances and accrued interest due from NBB as of last           +
       |   November, according to Goodwood's annual report.                     +
       |                                                                        +

  7135 | ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs                            +
       |   The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and                               +
       |   Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and      +
       |   currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,      +
       |   economists said.                                                     +
       |       "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in        +
       |   1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be          +
       |   screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve        +
       |   Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.                            +
       |       Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.       +
       |   after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.          +
       |       Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,       +
       |   the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric          +
       |   against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their      +
       |   currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.         +
       |       The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized             +
       |   countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the      +
       |   currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main       +
       |   focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to      +
       |   close the competiveness gap for American goods.                      +
       |       U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he        +
       |   expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.              +
       |       But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their         +
       |   own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not          +
       |   risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries        +
       |   of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and           +
       |   Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.               +
       |       "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was              +
       |   Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of      +
       |   Lloyds Bank PLC.                                                     +
       |       Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore       +
       |   and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170      +
       |   billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.                 +
       |       The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in      +
       |   1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade            +
       |   deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.       +
       |       And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is          +
       |   continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6             +
       |   billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The        +
       |   gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.        +
       |       Lately both nations have said they will take steps to            +
       |   defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many      +
       |   of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import            +
       |   tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.       +
       |       Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last       +
       |   week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to          +
       |   five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.        +
       |       For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut            +
       |   tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and       +
       |   try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang            +
       |   Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect            +
       |   Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.              +
       |       The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles        +
       |   and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the        +
       |   area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.               +
       |       Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America       +
       |   -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.            +
       |       "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When       +
       |   their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing       +
       |   base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob         +
       |   Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.         +
       |       The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,      +
       |   72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its                +
       |   telecommunications equipment.                                        +
       |       A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and       +
       |   South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.           +
       |       While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the       +
       |   U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.       +
       |       But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in        +
       |   marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into       +
       |   large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade       +
       |   and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.                +
       |       Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to         +
       |   18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and           +
       |   Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.            +
       |       Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.               +
       |       "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been       +
       |   at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.       +
       |       February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers          +
       |   exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.         +
       |       But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response          +
       |   from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work         +
       |   with a sizeable lag, economists say.                                 +
       |       The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and        +
       |   Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is         +
       |   pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since              +
       |   September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.        +
       |       But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against        +
       |   the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.        +
       |       "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those          +
       |   countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said           +
       |   Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.                                             +
       |       And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their         +
       |   hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.         +
       |       Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will        +
       |   get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to      +
       |   see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then      +
       |   the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.            +
       |                                                                        +

  8111 | MALAYSIAN 1987 ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN ABOVE FORECAST                     +
       |   The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd                                +
       |   (DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp)       +
       |   in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one        +
       |   pct.                                                                 +
       |       It said in a report that because of an economic recovery         +
       |   and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is       +
       |   unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.                     +
       |       The report was presented at a two-day investment conference      +
       |   organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks.           +
       |       The report said rising commodity prices and the continued        +
       |   expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous          +
       |   fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for         +
       |   cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.                       +
       |       It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60       +
       |   and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the       +
       |   year.                                                                +
       |       But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external       +
       |   debt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said              +
       |   Malaysia's external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs      +
       |   and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct.                           +
       |                                                                        +

  8119 | MINISTER PREDICTS ONE PCT INFLATION FOR SINGAPORE                      +
       |   Singapore will have an inflation rate                                +
       |   of one pct in 1987, up from a negative 1.4 pct in 1986, Trade        +
       |   and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament.               +
       |       He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall      +
       |   in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and       +
       |   oil-related items.                                                   +
       |       But Lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be       +
       |   repeated this year because of projected higher prices for            +
       |   primary commodities and oil.                                         +

       |       He said the captain of the Singapore-registered tanker Nord      +

  8902 | STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BAD-DEBT PROVISIONS                         +
       |   Standard Chartered Plc &lt;STCH.L>, faced                            +
       |   with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and      +
       |   an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its          +
       |   bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.              +
       |       Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that       +
       |   bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,         +
       |   stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.                +
       |       Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in       +
       |   the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax        +
       |   breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while          +
       |   71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.       +
       |       In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for      +
       |   1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total            +
       |   pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.               +
       |       "The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore     +
       |   and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping             +
       |   industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and        +
       |   doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on      +
       |   top of the normal level of provisioning," Barber said.               +
       |       He said, "the decision was also taken to build up loan loss      +
       |   reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for           +
       |   general provisions for commercial and cross border risks."           +
       |       Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific       +
       |   region made "a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits."          +
       |       He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses        +
       |   was "well maintained, although the reported result was affected      +
       |   by cross border debt provisioning," while Californian subsidiary     +
       |   Union Bank "showed continued growth."                                +
       |       "Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in       +
       |   excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued," he      +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a            +
       |   takeover bid by Lloyds Bank &lt;LLOY.L> last year, strengthened      +
       |   its capital resources during that year to just over three            +
       |   billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.           +
       |       Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary        +
       |   capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.              +
       |                                                                        +
       |                                                                        +

       |   second half, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told        +
       |   parliament.                                                          +
       |       The figures compared with 3.4 pct contraction and 1.2 pct        +
       |   growth respectively for the first and second quarters of 1986.       +
       |       The estimates were based on a tentative leading indicator        +
       |   incorporating new business orders, company inventories and           +
       |   share prices used by his ministry, Lee said, without giving          +
       |   further details of the new indicator.                                +
       |       Singapore's economy grew 1.9 pct last year, after shrinking      +
       |   1.8 pct in 1985. The government has forecast growth rate of          +
       |   three to four pct for 1987.                                          +

  9203 | MIXED ASIAN REACTION TO NEW RUBBER PACT                                +
       |   Governments of major Asian                                           +
       |   producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new            +
       |   International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and       +
       |   traders are unhappy with the development, according to views         +
       |   polled by Reuter correspondents.                                     +
       |       Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which             +
       |   produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the       +
       |   new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber       +
       |   industries remain viable in the long-term.                           +
       |       But traders and growers said they were against the new pact      +
       |   because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere          +
       |   with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.        +
       |       The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on        +
       |   October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's              +
       |   producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.                       +
       |       It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in        +
       |   New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter          +
       |   into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting       +
       |   for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.      +
       |       Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said         +
       |   the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of             +
       |   liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber       +
       |   and a possible depression of prices.                                 +
       |       He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to      +
       |   keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose        +
       |   or fell through its buffer stock system.                             +
       |       Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of        +
       |   purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a        +
       |   contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done             +
       |   through direct cash contributions from members, he said.             +
       |       Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to        +
       |   finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed          +
       |   with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become            +
       |   indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International        +
       |   Tin Agreement.                                                       +
       |       "This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out      +
       |   without any financial encumbrance," Lim said.                        +
       |        Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking             +
       |   cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers      +
       |   and consumers would also become members, he said.                    +
       |       Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit       +
       |   to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.              +
       |       It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because       +
       |   its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.          +
       |       Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new         +
       |   pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt       +
       |   the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market             +
       |   operations.                                                          +
       |        Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free          +
       |   rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at       +
       |   levels that were only acceptable to consumers.                       +
       |       "With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable      +
       |   level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,      +
       |   while producers may never see sharp price rises," a Malaysian        +
       |   Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters.                        +
       |       Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the           +
       |   overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had              +
       |   psychologically prevented price rises, he said.                      +
       |       State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had          +
       |   been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a          +
       |   buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.                      +
       |       Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was      +
       |   expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.                    +
       |       Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be           +
       |   pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to       +
       |   stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers      +
       |   to produce more.                                                     +
       |       Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's         +
       |   conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to        +
       |   allow sharp price fluctuations in future.                            +
       |       "The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be             +
       |   liquidated and a free market returned," a Malaysian trader said.     +
       |       Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success      +
       |   as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they       +
       |   questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers        +
       |   to finance buffer stock operations.                                  +

       |   to 50.99 billion ringgit, from 1985's 42.3 billion, the Central      +

       |       Bank Negara said although Malaysia's net borrowing dropped       +
       |   in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation       +
       |   of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is             +
       |   pegged.                                                              +

       |       Bank Negara said growth in external debt, which declined         +

       |   1985, rose by 20.2 pct in 1986.                                      +

 10593 | NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE                           +
       |   The London Metal Exchange's, LME,                                    +
       |   decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,       +
       |   with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a          +
       |   positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.                +
       |       Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum      +
       |   purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,          +
       |   1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct        +
       |   contract.                                                            +
       |       This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European         +
       |   delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at           +
       |   Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts.                   +
       |       Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with      +
       |   existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt             +
       |   material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.                +
       |       The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive      +
       |   move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and         +
       |   Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to             +
       |   warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.            +
       |       Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler        +
       |   with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost      +
       |   exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be        +
       |   done during the sterling rings, they added.                          +
       |       LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more          +
       |   closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the        +
       |   recent wide backwardations.                                          +
       |       Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct           +
       |   purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc        +
       |   countries, such as Romania.                                          +
       |       The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined       +
       |   as an exporter recently, they said.                                  +
       |       Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from         +
       |   liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to            +
       |   centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where      +
       |   there are many holders of large short positions on the LME.          +
       |       But others said the new contract would soon attract trading      +
       |   interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been               +
       |   attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.                 +
       |       The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a         +
       |   new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where        +
       |   high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they       +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will            +
       |   eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like      +
       |   standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,        +
       |   gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process        +
       |   in this case may take longer, they added.                            +
       |       Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore              +
       |   warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,      +
       |   which make physical trading difficult, would not totally             +
       |   disappear as a result, the trade sources said.                       +
       |       These premiums for prompt metal have become a                    +
       |   semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased          +
       |   business and volatility in traded options, and are presently         +
       |   around 50 stg.                                                       +
       |       Increasingly large granting of option positions has been         +
       |   taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at       +
       |   the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes       +
       |   around these dates are commonplace, they said.                       +
       |       Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern         +
       |   operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of       +
       |   having to cover.                                                     +
       |       But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even       +
       |   though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the      +
       |   declaration and prompt dates.                                        +
       |       These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the        +
       |   month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.            +
       |       Backwardations will remain while operators continue to           +
       |   grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds        +
       |   aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.                   +
       |                                                                        +

       |   Exchange's (LME) decision to list Singapore as a delivery point      +
       |   for the LME's new dollar-denominated aluminium contract.             +
       |       Tay Thiam Peng, manager for international trading at the         +
       |   Trade Development Board, said the decision would boost               +
       |   Singapore's image as a major delivery port.                          +
       |       "We hope this will encourage more metal traders to set up        +

       |       Year on year, M-1 grew by 15.6 pct in January compared with      +
       |   an 11.8 pct growth in December.                                      +
       |       The January rise was largely seasonal, reflecting an             +
       |   increase in currency in active circulation prior to the Lunar        +
       |   New Year. Currency in active circulation rose to 5.42 billion        +

       |       The demand deposit component of M-1 dropped in January by        +

       |   a year ago, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said.                +

 11830 | PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING                       +
       |   A proposed sales tax on gold transactions                            +
       |   could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of      +
       |   trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and        +
       |   Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press        +
       |   conference.                                                          +
       |       "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,       +
       |   Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"     +
       |   he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would      +
       |   be unable to compete in the international market, he added.          +
       |       "How can the government really raise taxes if the system         +
       |   they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.         +
       |       The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades       +
       |   exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen      +
       |   tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.       +
       |       The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading       +
       |   more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,         +
       |   gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as         +
       |   that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.                           +
       |       However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and           +
       |   coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.           +
       |       Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold        +
       |   turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.        +
       |       A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early           +
       |   1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks      +
       |   fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.        +
       |       Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the         +
       |   volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.                      +
       |       While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the            +
       |   volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London         +
       |   and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.             +

       |       Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the       +

       |       The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a       +
       |   substantial part of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt.        +
       |       It said as part of the agreement, its current direct             +
       |   investment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture with       +
       |   Ajinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement for       +

       |       The company said the change in the Japanese arrangement          +

 12397 | SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH                      +
       |   Singapore's major banks are                                          +
       |   diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from        +
       |   loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.                     +
       |       The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank    +
       |   Ltd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking     +
       |   Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.         +
       |       The shift towards securitisation has been helped by              +
       |   volatile financial markets which have developed hedging              +
       |   facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk            +
       |   management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.        +
       |       Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see        +
       |   limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are             +
       |   switching from term lending to major growth areas such as            +
       |   stockbroking and fee based income, he said.                          +
       |       Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being         +
       |   granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now       +
       |   moving into the new government securities market and the Stock       +
       |   Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.                  +
       |       One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the             +
       |   Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity      +
       |   market in Singapore.                                                 +
       |       Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has        +
       |   increased business transactions and provided long term growth        +
       |   for the market. The banks are not competition for individual         +
       |   stockbroking firms because of the increased business they            +
       |   generate, he added.                                                  +
       |       Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand            +
       |   equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because       +
       |   of the increasing ability of foreign and local market                +
       |   participants to absorb new issues.                                   +
       |       Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of     +
       |   the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to       +
       |   launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors        +
       |   seeking capital growth through a diversified international           +
       |   portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the           +
       |   emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.                      +
       |       &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the       +
       |   Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong          +
       |   Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.              +
       |       Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in          +
       |   Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be        +
       |   forced to provide fund management services for major clients         +
       |   seeking better returns, he said.                                     +
       |       Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major           +
       |   banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from        +
       |   treasury and investment banking activities.                          +
       |       They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese        +
       |   and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct       +
       |   against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.              +
       |       Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40         +
       |   mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.               +
       |       The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in        +
       |   1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by               +
       |   &lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary     +
       |   of the bank, they said.                                              +

       |   Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered                            +
       |   about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July        +
       |   1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan          +
       |   dollar against the U.S. Currency.                                    +
       |       Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics                 +
       |   department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to      +
       |   increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.               +
       |       The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar      +
       |   today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since            +
       |   September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June         +
       |   and to 32 by the end of this year.                                   +
       |       Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion          +
       |   dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's       +
       |   third largest after West Germany and Japan.                          +
       |       Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled           +
       |   about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.        +
       |   The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at        +
       |   about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and      +
       |   Singapore.                                                           +
       |       About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash,            +
       |   mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury          +

       |       The National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, will receive     +
       |   almost 1.8 mln dlrs for use in the areas of food service,       +
       |   consumer education and marketing. In addition the board         +
       |   allocated 375,000 dlrs in use in "Pork - The Other White Meat"  +
       |   campaign, according to a Pork Board spokesperson.               +
       |       The National Livestock and Meat Board will receive 644,000  +
       |   dlrs to continue work in educating health care officials.       +
       |   120,000 dlrs in matching funds will be provided to the meat     +
       |   board for use in the development of a better market for         +

  1675 | GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS                    +
       |   The ruling GATT Council deferred a                              +
       |   decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a +
       |   European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese         +
       |   agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.                +
       |       David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs  +
       |   and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties    +
       |   would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of         +
       |   resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.  +
       |       The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect    +
       |   the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,  +
       |   officially known as semiconductors.                             +
       |       The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by +
       |   allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum    +
       |   prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.              +
       |       The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave     +
       |   U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.      +
       |       Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,  +
       |   Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC +
       |   complaint during the heated Council debate.                     +
       |       Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael  +
       |   Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were        +
       |   unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.   +
       |                                                                   +

  2998 | IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY                  +
       |   Japanese customers have bought nearly six                       +
       |   mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company  +
       |   (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and     +
       |   Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese   +
       |   traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.              +
       |       NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese      +
       |   customers with different formulas. One company has bought       +
       |   800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of      +
       |   30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.         +
       |       Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and  +
       |   Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.                   +
       |                                                                   +
       |       Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to       +
       |   reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot     +
       |   markets, oil traders said.                                      +
       |       Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder     +
       |   weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was  +
       |   below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.       +
       |       Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish      +
       |   sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market    +
       |   are supporting spot price levels, they said.                    +
       |                                                                   +
       |       Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price  +
       |   but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a +
       |   discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one +
       |   Japanese trader said.                                           +
       |       The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the     +
       |   official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln        +
       |   barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in     +
       |   Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have     +
       |   been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the   +
       |   official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the   +
       |   price related to processing arrangements.                       +
       |                                                                   +

  3615 | U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR                  +
       |   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit                              +
       |   on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs  +
       |   in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce         +
       |   Department said.                                                +
       |       The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15       +
       |   billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously    +
       |   reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.      +
       |       For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a +
       |   record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,  +
       |   the department said.                                            +
       |       During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78        +
       |   billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports   +
       |   rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.      +
       |       The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes    +
       |   such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and    +
       |   insurance.                                                      +
       |       The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the   +
       |   quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion   +
       |   dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose  +
       |   1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars   +
       |   from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.                              +
       |       Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct      +
       |   because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department +
       |   said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18  +
       |   pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars   +
       |   and a nine pct decrease from Japan.                             +
       |       On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs +
       |   or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct +
       |   or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.                     +
       |       Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because    +
       |   supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were        +
       |   limited by drought.                                             +
       |       Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America     +
       |   rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 +
       |   mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200  +
       |   mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.                         +
       |       The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,   +
       |   including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell    +
       |   500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit  +
       |   decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.      +
       |       In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or    +
       |   nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3   +
       |   billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.                +
       |       Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6       +
       |   billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower    +
       |   prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs    +
       |   from 26.41 dlrs.                                                +
       |       Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct   +
       |   to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell +
       |   27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and   +
       |   soybeans nine pct.                                              +
       |       The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1      +
       |   billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe       +
       |   increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.                +
       |                                                                   +

  5792 | KOBE RUBBER EXCHANGE TO EXTEND TRADING HOURS                      +
       |   The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will                           +
       |   extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to +
       |   use the exchange.                                               +
       |       Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry     +
       |   approval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at     +
       |   1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at the  +
       |   new session the following day before the opening call starts at +
       |   0930 local time, an Exchange official said.                     +
       |       Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producer    +
       |   price indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active after +
       |   the end of the current final session here.                      +
       |       The introduction of the new session will enable             +
       |   participants to trade overnight after taking account of         +
       |   Singapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who are    +
       |   designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume   +
       |   traded overnight to the new final session before the opening    +
       |   session starts next day, the official said.                     +
       |       But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which +
       |   sets a fixed price at each session, the price of contracts      +
       |   traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth   +
       |   session, he added.                                              +
       |       Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve +
       |   the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures         +
       |   industry to expand and internationalise.                        +
       |       The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, which     +
       |   also trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans to    +
       |   introduce an extra session.                                     +
       |       TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day. Four     +
       |   sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions,    +
       |   but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time.      +
       |                                                                   +

  7135 | ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs                       +
       |   The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and                          +
       |   Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and +
       |   currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, +
       |   economists said.                                                +
       |       "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in   +
       |   1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be     +
       |   screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve   +
       |   Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.                       +
       |       Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.  +
       |   after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.     +
       |       Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,  +
       |   the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric     +
       |   against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their +
       |   currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.    +
       |       The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized        +
       |   countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the +
       |   currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main  +
       |   focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to +
       |   close the competiveness gap for American goods.                 +
       |       U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he   +
       |   expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.         +
       |       But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their    +
       |   own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not     +
       |   risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries   +
       |   of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and      +
       |   Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.          +
       |       "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was         +
       |   Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of +
       |   Lloyds Bank PLC.                                                +
       |       Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore  +
       |   and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 +
       |   billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.            +
       |       The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in +
       |   1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade       +
       |   deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.  +
       |       And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is     +
       |   continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6        +
       |   billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The   +
       |   gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.   +
       |       Lately both nations have said they will take steps to       +
       |   defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many +
       |   of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import       +
       |   tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.  +
       |       Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last  +
       |   week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to     +
       |   five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.   +
       |       For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut       +
       |   tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and  +
       |   try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang       +
       |   Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect       +
       |   Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.         +
       |       The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles   +
       |   and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the   +
       |   area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.          +
       |       Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America  +
       |   -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.       +
       |       "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When  +
       |   their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing  +
       |   base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob    +
       |   Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.    +
       |       The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, +
       |   72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its           +
       |   telecommunications equipment.                                   +
       |       A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and  +
       |   South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.      +
       |       While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the  +
       |   U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.  +
       |       But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in   +
       |   marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into  +
       |   large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade  +
       |   and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.           +
       |       Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to    +
       |   18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and      +
       |   Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.       +
       |       Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.          +
       |       "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been  +
       |   at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.  +
       |       February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers     +
       |   exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.    +
       |       But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response     +
       |   from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work    +
       |   with a sizeable lag, economists say.                            +
       |       The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and   +
       |   Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is    +
       |   pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since         +
       |   September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.   +
       |       But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against   +
       |   the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.   +
       |       "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those     +
       |   countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said      +
       |   Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.                                        +
       |       And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their    +
       |   hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.    +
       |       Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will   +
       |   get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to +
       |   see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then +
       |   the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.       +
       |                                                                   +
       |                                                                   +

 11830 | PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING                  +
       |   A proposed sales tax on gold transactions                       +
       |   could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of +
       |   trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and   +
       |   Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press   +
       |   conference.                                                     +
       |       "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,  +
       |   Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"+
       |   he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would +
       |   be unable to compete in the international market, he added.     +
       |       "How can the government really raise taxes if the system    +
       |   they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.    +
       |       The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades  +
       |   exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen +
       |   tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.  +
       |       The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading  +
       |   more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,    +
       |   gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as    +
       |   that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.                      +
       |       However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and      +
       |   coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.      +
       |       Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold   +
       |   turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.   +
       |       A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early      +
       |   1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks +
       |   fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.   +
       |       Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the    +
       |   volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.                 +
       |       While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the       +
       |   volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London    +
       |   and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.        +
       |       Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average  +
       |   just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.                       +
       |       Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the  +
       |   government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to     +
       |   commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers  +
       |   said.                                                           +
       |       Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese       +
       |   trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign     +
       |   participant.                                                    +
       |       Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one  +
       |   and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while       +
       |   futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers     +
       |   said.                                                           +
       |       "All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo +
       |   market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three      +
       |   major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal     +
       |   opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper  +
       |   on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"+
       |   Hofer said.                                                     +
       |       "I don't think it fits the philosophy of an                 +
       |   internationalising market," he added.                           +
       |       Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,         +
       |   attending the press conference, said they supported Credit      +
       |   Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.    +
       |                                                                   +

       |       The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a  +
       |   substantial part of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt.   +
       |       It said as part of the agreement, its current direct        +
       |   investment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture with  +
       |   Ajinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement for  +
       |   the long-term utilization of technology and trademarks.         +
       |       The company said the change in the Japanese arrangement     +
       |   will give Ajinomoto full equity ownership while leaving CPC a   +
       |   continuing earnings stream and cash flow.                       +
       |       The transactions are subject to definitive agreements and   +

       |       CPC said not included in the 340 mln dlr consideration are  +
       |   proceeds from the sale of some smaller Asian investments,       +
       |   including a 51 pct equity interest in an oat-based food venture +

       |       The company said the actions being taken under its          +
       |   restructuring program, including the sale of its European corn  +
       |   wet milling business and other assets, overhead reductions and  +
       |   other expense items and the Asian transactions, will have a     +
       |   one-time positive effect on 1987 earnings.                      +
       |       CPC said "Although the extent cannot yet be determined, the +

 12416 | RISING TAIWAN DOLLAR CAUSES FOREIGN RESERVES LOSS                 +
       |   Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered                       +
       |   about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July   +
       |   1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan     +
       |   dollar against the U.S. Currency.                               +
       |       Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics            +
       |   department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to +
       |   increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.          +
       |       The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar +
       |   today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since       +
       |   September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June    +
       |   and to 32 by the end of this year.                              +
       |       Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion     +
       |   dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's  +
       |   third largest after West Germany and Japan.                     +
       |       Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled      +
       |   about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.   +
       |   The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at   +
       |   about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and +
       |   Singapore.                                                      +
       |       About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash,       +
       |   mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury     +
       |   bills, certificates of deposit and bonds.                       +
       |                                                                   +

 12849 | LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES USSR TIMECHARTERS                  +
       |   Active timecharter fixing by Soviet                             +
       |   operators to cover USSR grain imports featured the freight      +
       |   market, ship brokers said.                                      +
       |       At least two fixtures were reported on Soviet account to    +

       |   voyage via lower Baltic Sea and redelivery passing Skaw at      +

       |   via the U.K. And redelivery Skaw-Cape Passero at 4,500 dlrs     +
       |   daily.                                                          +
       |       The Soviets also secured a 34,000 tonner from Gibraltar for +
       |   a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,500 dlrs daily and a 61,000    +
       |   tonner for similar business at 6,750 dlrs daily.                +
       |       Brokers said several other fixtures were also thought to be +
       |   connected with Soviet grain, including a 69,000 tonner from     +
       |   Taranto for five to seven months at 6,500 dlrs daily. Similar   +
       |   fixing was reported yesterday at 6,000 dlrs.                    +
       |       Other timecharter fixing included a 14,000 tonner from      +
       |   Indonesia to the U.S. Gulf at 2,800 dlrs daily and a combined   +
       |   carrier of 75,000 tonnes dw from the U.S. Gulf to Italy at      +
       |   9,000 dlrs daily.                                               +

       |       Grain fixing was much quieter out of the U.S. Gulf, with no +
       |   fresh business seen on the significant routes to the Continent  +
       |   or Japan, although tonnage was secured for at least five small  +
       |   corn cargoes from the Gulf to Jamaica at between 21 and 25      +
       |   dlrs. Wheat from the River Plate and Buenos Aires to Sri Lanka  +
       |   received 26 dlrs.                                               +
       |       Market talk suggested 11 dlrs had been paid for grain from  +
       |   the U.S. North Pacific to Japan but no confirmation was         +

       |       Fairly active grain fixing emerged out of the Continent,    +
       |   however, with maize covered from Nantes to Egypt at 15 dlrs,    +
       |   and bagged flour from Greece to China at 27 dlrs.               +
       |       Barley cargoes were arranged from Immingham to the Red Sea  +

       |   consumer education and marketing. In addition the board         +

  1675 | GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS                    +
       |   The ruling GATT Council deferred a                              +
       |   decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a +
       |   European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese         +
       |   agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.                +
       |       David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs  +
       |   and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties    +
       |   would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of         +
       |   resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.  +
       |       The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect    +
       |   the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,  +
       |   officially known as semiconductors.                             +
       |       The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by +
       |   allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum    +
       |   prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.              +
       |       The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave     +
       |   U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.      +
       |       Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,  +
       |   Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC +
       |   complaint during the heated Council debate.                     +
       |       Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael  +
       |   Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were        +
       |   unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.   +

  2998 | IRAN SELLING DISCOUNTED CRUDE, JAPAN TRADERS SAY                  +
       |   Japanese customers have bought nearly six                       +
       |   mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company  +
       |   (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and     +
       |   Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese   +
       |   traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.              +
       |       NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese      +
       |   customers with different formulas. One company has bought       +
       |   800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of      +
       |   30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.         +
       |       Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and  +
       |   Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.                   +
       |                                                                   +
       |       Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to       +
       |   reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot     +
       |   markets, oil traders said.                                      +
       |       Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder     +
       |   weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was  +
       |   below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.       +
       |       Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish      +
       |   sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market    +
       |   are supporting spot price levels, they said.                    +
       |                                                                   +
       |       Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price  +
       |   but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a +
       |   discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one +
       |   Japanese trader said.                                           +
       |       The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the     +
       |   official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln        +
       |   barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in     +
       |   Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have     +
       |   been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the   +
       |   official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the   +
       |   price related to processing arrangements.                       +

  3615 | U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR                  +
       |   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit                              +
       |   on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs  +
       |   in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce         +
       |   Department said.                                                +
       |       The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15       +
       |   billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously    +
       |   reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.      +
       |       For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a +
       |   record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,  +
       |   the department said.                                            +
       |       During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78        +
       |   billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports   +
       |   rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.      +
       |       The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes    +
       |   such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and    +
       |   insurance.                                                      +
       |       The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the   +
       |   quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion   +
       |   dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose  +
       |   1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars   +
       |   from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.                              +
       |       Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct      +
       |   because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department +
       |   said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18  +
       |   pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars   +
       |   and a nine pct decrease from Japan.                             +
       |       On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs +
       |   or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct +
       |   or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.                     +
       |       Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because    +
       |   supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were        +
       |   limited by drought.                                             +
       |       Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America     +
       |   rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 +
       |   mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200  +
       |   mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.                         +
       |       The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,   +
       |   including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell    +

  5792 | KOBE RUBBER EXCHANGE TO EXTEND TRADING HOURS                      +
       |   The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will                           +
       |   extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to +
       |   use the exchange.                                               +
       |       Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry     +
       |   approval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at     +
       |   1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at the  +
       |   new session the following day before the opening call starts at +
       |   0930 local time, an Exchange official said.                     +
       |       Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producer    +
       |   price indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active after +
       |   the end of the current final session here.                      +
       |       The introduction of the new session will enable             +
       |   participants to trade overnight after taking account of         +
       |   Singapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who are    +
       |   designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume   +
       |   traded overnight to the new final session before the opening    +
       |   session starts next day, the official said.                     +
       |       But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which +
       |   sets a fixed price at each session, the price of contracts      +
       |   traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth   +
       |   session, he added.                                              +
       |       Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve +
       |   the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures         +
       |   industry to expand and internationalise.                        +
       |       The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, which     +
       |   also trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans to    +
       |   introduce an extra session.                                     +
       |       TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day. Four     +
       |   sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions,    +
       |   but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time.      +
       |                                                                   +

  7135 | ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs                       +
       |   The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and                          +
       |   Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and +
       |   currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, +
       |   economists said.                                                +
       |       "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in   +
       |   1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be     +
       |   screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve   +
       |   Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.                       +
       |       Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.  +
       |   after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.     +
       |       Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,  +
       |   the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric     +
       |   against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their +
       |   currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.    +
       |       The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized        +
       |   countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the +
       |   currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main  +
       |   focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to +
       |   close the competiveness gap for American goods.                 +
       |       U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he   +
       |   expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.         +
       |       But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their    +
       |   own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not     +
       |   risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries   +
       |   of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and      +
       |   Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.          +
       |       "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was         +
       |   Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of +
       |   Lloyds Bank PLC.                                                +
       |       Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore  +
       |   and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 +
       |   billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.            +
       |       The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in +
       |   1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade       +
       |   deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.  +
       |       And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is     +
       |   continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6        +
       |   billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The   +
       |   gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.   +
       |       Lately both nations have said they will take steps to       +
       |   defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many +
       |   of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import       +
       |   tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.  +
       |       Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last  +
       |   week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to     +
       |   five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.   +
       |       For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut       +
       |   tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and  +
       |   try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang       +
       |   Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect       +
       |   Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.         +
       |       The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles   +
       |   and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the   +
       |   area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.          +
       |       Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America  +
       |   -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.       +
       |       "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When  +
       |   their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing  +
       |   base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob    +
       |   Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.    +
       |       The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, +
       |   72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its           +
       |   telecommunications equipment.                                   +
       |       A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and  +
       |   South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.      +
       |       While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the  +
       |   U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.  +
       |       But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in   +
       |   marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into  +
       |   large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade  +
       |   and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.           +
       |       Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to    +
       |   18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and      +
       |   Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.       +
       |       Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.          +
       |       "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been  +
       |   at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.  +
       |       February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers     +
       |   exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.    +
       |       But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response     +
       |   from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work    +
       |   with a sizeable lag, economists say.                            +
       |       The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and   +
       |   Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is    +
       |   pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since         +
       |   September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.   +
       |       But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against   +
       |   the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.   +
       |       "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those     +
       |   countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said      +
       |   Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.                                        +
       |       And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their    +
       |   hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.    +
       |       Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will   +
       |   get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to +
       |   see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then +
       |   the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.       +
       |                                                                   +
       |                                                                   +

 11830 | PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING                  +
       |   A proposed sales tax on gold transactions                       +
       |   could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of +
       |   trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and   +
       |   Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press   +
       |   conference.                                                     +
       |       "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,  +
       |   Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"+
       |   he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would +
       |   be unable to compete in the international market, he added.     +
       |       "How can the government really raise taxes if the system    +
       |   they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.    +
       |       The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades  +
       |   exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen +
       |   tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.  +
       |       The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading  +
       |   more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,    +
       |   gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as    +
       |   that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.                      +
       |       However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and      +
       |   coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.      +
       |       Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold   +
       |   turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.   +
       |       A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early      +
       |   1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks +
       |   fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.   +
       |       Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the    +
       |   volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.                 +
       |       While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the       +
       |   volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London    +
       |   and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.        +
       |       Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average  +
       |   just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.                       +
       |       Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the  +
       |   government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to     +
       |   commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers  +
       |   said.                                                           +
       |       Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese       +
       |   trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign     +
       |   participant.                                                    +
       |       Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one  +
       |   and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while       +
       |   futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers     +
       |   said.                                                           +
       |       "All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo +
       |   market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three      +
       |   major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal     +
       |   opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper  +
       |   on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"+
       |   Hofer said.                                                     +
       |       "I don't think it fits the philosophy of an                 +

       |       Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,         +
       |   attending the press conference, said they supported Credit      +

       |   grocery products operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the         +
       |   Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand to &lt;Ajinomoto Co +
       |   Inc> of Japan for 340 mln dlrs.                                 +
       |       The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a  +
       |   substantial part of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt.   +
       |       It said as part of the agreement, its current direct        +
       |   investment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture with  +
       |   Ajinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement for  +
       |   the long-term utilization of technology and trademarks.         +
       |       The company said the change in the Japanese arrangement     +
       |   will give Ajinomoto full equity ownership while leaving CPC a   +
       |   continuing earnings stream and cash flow.                       +
       |       The transactions are subject to definitive agreements and   +
       |   government approvals.                                           +
       |       CPC said not included in the 340 mln dlr consideration are  +
       |   proceeds from the sale of some smaller Asian investments,       +
       |   including a 51 pct equity interest in an oat-based food venture +
       |   to an Australian partner.                                       +
       |       The company said the actions being taken under its          +
       |   restructuring program, including the sale of its European corn  +
       |   wet milling business and other assets, overhead reductions and  +
       |   other expense items and the Asian transactions, will have a     +
       |   one-time positive effect on 1987 earnings.                      +
       |       CPC said "Although the extent cannot yet be determined, the +
       |   company expects that 1987 earnings per share will increase by   +
       |   substantially more than the previously estimated 20 pct         +
       |   increase over 1986."  In 1986 CPC earned 2.30 dlrs per share.   +
       |                                                                   +

 12416 | RISING TAIWAN DOLLAR CAUSES FOREIGN RESERVES LOSS                 +
       |   Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered                       +
       |   about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July   +
       |   1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan     +
       |   dollar against the U.S. Currency.                               +
       |       Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics            +
       |   department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to +
       |   increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen.          +
       |       The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar +
       |   today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since       +
       |   September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June    +
       |   and to 32 by the end of this year.                              +
       |       Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion     +
       |   dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's  +
       |   third largest after West Germany and Japan.                     +
       |       Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled      +
       |   about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.   +
       |   The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at   +
       |   about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and +
       |   Singapore.                                                      +
       |       About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash,       +
       |   mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury     +
       |   bills, certificates of deposit and bonds.                       +
       |                                                                   +

   297 | JAPAN BUYS SOME 95,000 TONNES SOYBEANS FROM CHINA                      +
       |   Japanese importers bought some 95,000                                +
       |   tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September      +
       |   shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources         +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs       +
       |   from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down        +
       |   from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.                   +
       |       Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices        +
       |   in Chicago plus the FOB premium.                                     +
       |       Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot           +
       |   buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986      +
       |   crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some             +
       |   300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.                  +
       |       Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to           +
       |   remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the         +
       |   sources said.                                                        +
       |       In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese       +
       |   edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,       +
       |   but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of       +
       |   Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.                        +
       |                                                                        +

  1675 | GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS                         +
       |   The ruling GATT Council deferred a                                   +
       |   decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a      +
       |   European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese              +
       |   agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.                     +
       |       David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs       +
       |   and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties         +
       |   would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of              +
       |   resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.       +
       |       The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect         +
       |   the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,       +
       |   officially known as semiconductors.                                  +
       |       The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by      +
       |   allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum         +
       |   prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.                   +
       |       The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave          +
       |   U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.           +
       |       Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland,       +
       |   Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC      +
       |   complaint during the heated Council debate.                          +
       |       Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael       +
       |   Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were             +
       |   unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.        +
       |                                                                        +

   342 | JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS                        +
       |   Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level                                +
       |   trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are        +
       |   growing increasingly irritated with each other.                      +
       |       The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the      +
       |   whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way      +
       |   for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day             +
       |   stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.               +
       |       Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,         +
       |   the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to       +
       |   reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.            +
       |       "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese             +
       |   government official said. "But we are also frustrated."              +
       |       The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last       +
       |   18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash             +
       |   spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.       +
       |   That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,       +
       |   but it will, he said.                                                +
       |       He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress        +
       |   that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that         +
       |   remain when it talks with Congress.                                  +
       |       "It would only take five minutes to list their                   +
       |   accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.                    +
       |       The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the      +
       |   economic structures of both countries and how they affect the        +
       |   bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48         +
       |   billion dlrs in Japan's favour.                                      +
       |       On the following two days, the topics will range from            +
       |   multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General           +
       |   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade        +
       |   problems as super computers.                                         +
       |       The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling            +
       |   discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include        +
       |   savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and            +
       |   housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.         +
       |       These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the         +
       |   Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic             +
       |   pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and               +
       |   stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.                      +
       |       Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of         +
       |   boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.           +
       |       Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge        +
       |   U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade        +
       |   imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is            +
       |   buying more imports.                                                 +
       |       Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft      +
       |   trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial       +
       |   trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one        +
       |   Japanese official said.                                              +
       |       That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out       +
       |   bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.        +
       |       Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's        +
       |   trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal        +
       |   access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade      +
       |   action by the U.S., Officials said.                                  +
       |       Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak      +
       |   bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill      +
       |   overhanging them.                                                    +
       |       "We have no leverage," one official admitted.                    +
       |       As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints           +
       |   about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including          +
       |   super computers.                                                     +
       |       The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese          +
       |   super computer market.                                               +
       |       The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to         +
       |   public institutions like universities which buy the                  +
       |   sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up             +
       |   informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential       +
       |   sellers, officials said.                                             +
       |                                                                        +

  1385 | JAPAN CUTTING CHINA CORN COMMITMENTS - USDA                            +
       |   Japanese traders have apparently                                     +
       |   sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next        +
       |   six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department       +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       In its World Production and Trade Report, the department         +
       |   said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling       +
       |   to sell at current low world prices.                                 +
       |       If the reports are confirmed, China's major export               +
       |   destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could             +
       |   increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.                            +
       |       China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of          +

       |       Since last December the banks have been allowing the             +

       |       At least one company has expressed interest and                  +
       |   negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.                 +
       |       However, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the       +
       |   stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven        +
       |   mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking            +
       |   sources said.                                                        +

       |       He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint          +
       |   production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard     +
       |   Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been          +
       |   held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy           +
       |   Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy          +

       |       Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty        +

       |   which would complete production.                                     +

       |   Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.                       +
       |       He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of         +
       |   shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese        +
       |   technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to             +
       |   competitors in Europe and South Korea.                               +
       |       Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs          +
       |   since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands        +
       |   at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly       +
       |   three mln dlrs.                                                      +
       |       But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest               +
       |   shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun         +
       |   diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and        +
       |   other machinery.                                                     +
       |       "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification,"    +
       |   he said.                                                             +
       |       Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln      +
       |   U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the              +
       |   previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more      +
       |   than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.                                         +
       |       CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead         +
       |   weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships        +
       |   of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.                                  +
       |       Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least      +
       |   until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship              +
       |   repairing was bright.                                                +

       |   foreign exchange accounts at the Bank of China, the official         +
       |   Shenzhen Economic Zone Daily said.                                   +
       |       Previously only residents of Guangdong and Fujian provinces      +
       |   could do this.                                                       +
       |       The paper also said the minimum for opening a fixed deposit      +
       |   account had been cut to 50 yuan equivalent, from 150 yuan. The       +
       |   minimum for a current account is 20 yuan equivalent.                 +
       |       The paper said depositors could now withdraw all or part of      +
       |   their account, subject to a branch's reserves, instead of only       +
       |   a fixed amount as previously.                                        +

  3429 | USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT                              +
       |   The Soviet Union will likely honor                                   +
       |   its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four       +
       |   mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department              +
       |   official said.                                                       +
       |       "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no         +
       |   reason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters.          +
       |       "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European       +
       |   Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers          +
       |   from all sources at this point," the official said in                +
       |   explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports        +
       |   estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.                 +
       |       This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when         +
       |   analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for        +
       |   the first time in 15 years.                                          +
       |       A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern      +
       |   over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.        +
       |   corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's         +
       |   recent interest.                                                     +
       |       Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying          +
       |   countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,       +
       |   and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the         +
       |   official said.                                                       +
       |       "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"         +
       |   and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "As      +
       |   soon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added.                   +
       |       USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the            +
       |   Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the        +
       |   purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.                                   +
       |       The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets        +
       |   would enter the U.S. market again.                                   +
       |       "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the      +
       |   situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of         +
       |   frenetic buying now," the official said.                             +
       |       However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," he       +
       |   said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase       +
       |   commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet       +
       |   purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.                        +
       |       Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.         +
       |   is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to         +
       |   the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.       +
       |                                                                        +

       |   in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce              +
       |   Department said.                                                     +
       |       The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15            +
       |   billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously         +
       |   reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.           +
       |       For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a      +
       |   record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,       +
       |   the department said.                                                 +
       |       During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78             +
       |   billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports        +
       |   rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.           +
       |       The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes         +

       |       The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the        +
       |   quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion        +
       |   dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose       +
       |   1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars        +
       |   from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.                                   +
       |       Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct           +
       |   because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department      +
       |   said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18       +
       |   pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars        +
       |   and a nine pct decrease from Japan.                                  +
       |       On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs      +
       |   or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct      +
       |   or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.                          +
       |       Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because         +
       |   supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were             +
       |   limited by drought.                                                  +

       |       The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,        +
       |   including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell         +
       |   500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit       +
       |   decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.           +

       |   billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.                     +

       |   billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower         +
       |   prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs         +
       |   from 26.41 dlrs.                                                     +

  3488 | ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP                           +
       |   China's foreign debt reached 27 billion                              +
       |   dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to             +
       |   short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very             +
       |   creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign           +
       |   bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.                          +
       |       Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from        +
       |   an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased          +
       |   import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low,            +
       |   between eight and 10 pct.                                            +
       |       China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.        +
       |       Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations        +
       |   and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan           +
       |   agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on           +
       |   1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.        +
       |       Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in       +
       |   the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said          +
       |   they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.                     +
       |       A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much        +
       |   short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a        +
       |   result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive        +
       |   low interest rates in the Japanese market.                           +
       |       The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is         +
       |   likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.        +
       |       A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the      +
       |   country's total debt at about 30 pct.                                +
       |       The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house         +
       |   said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.      +
       |       "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,     +
       |   which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go      +
       |   elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," he          +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is        +
       |   in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital      +
       |   markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.                   +
       |       "Officials do not think of China but of their own department     +
       |   or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the          +
       |   full backing of the People's Republic of China," he said.            +
       |       "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other         +
       |   areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable          +
       |   autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to             +
       |   exercise indirect controls," he said.                                +
       |       The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the      +
       |   past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be            +
       |   affected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase         +
       |   meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of          +
       |   Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.                      +
       |       A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's             +
       |   foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially           +
       |   stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.                                    +
       |       "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the           +
       |   market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in         +
       |   advance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.         +
       |       The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Things       +
       |   are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in        +
       |   1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."          +
       |       Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9           +
       |   billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.                  +
       |       A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official      +
       |   said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more         +
       |   than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier          +
       |   than a year ago.                                                     +
       |       The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It       +

       |       "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," he      +

       |       A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful       +
       |   management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six        +
       |   to eight pct.                                                        +
       |       "We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange          +

       |   company on its performance, not its bank account," he said.          +
       |       He said China performed very well in the export field last       +
       |   year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have         +

  4049 | ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - MITSUBISHI HEAVY FIGHTS BACK                      +
       |   International efforts to redirect Japan's                            +
       |   export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy         +
       |   going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's        +
       |   biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by.                            +
       |       Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T> (MHI), which began   +
       |   making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130          +
       |   years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its         +
       |   efforts to maintain its share of export markets.                     +
       |       "If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products,          +
       |   everyone will buy them," MHI president Yotaro Iida said.             +
       |       Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and          +
       |   power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40         +
       |   pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to             +
       |   abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview.                     +
       |       Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has      +
       |   performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money        +
       |   Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year.                       +
       |       "We have made the utmost efforts among the world's               +
       |   manufacturers to improve productivity," he said. "You may be         +
       |   surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but      +
       |   the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers."              +
       |       Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that       +
       |   MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The           +
       |   company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in           +
       |   1976.                                                                +
       |       Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40         +
       |   pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March        +
       |   31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion.                             +
       |       And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in          +
       |   Mitsubishi Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen.               +
       |       Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a          +
       |   resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent       +
       |   recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power      +
       |   plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its             +
       |   exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct.       +
       |       MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the             +
       |   half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years         +
       |   ago.                                                                 +
       |       China is the most promising market, although MHI also            +
       |   considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major      +
       |   customers.                                                           +
       |       "Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a         +
       |   lack of foreign currency," Iida said. But he added that he felt      +
       |   MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government             +
       |   financial support.                                                   +
       |       It can also finance the plants itself and recover its            +
       |   investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could         +
       |   prove popular in the future.                                         +
       |       In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South       +
       |   Korean competition by building more technologically advanced         +
       |   carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products           +
       |   difficult to transport.                                              +
       |       Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the       +
       |   world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.         +
       |       Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects,           +
       |   including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch          +
       |   vehicles for man-made satellites.                                    +
       |       It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence         +
       |   Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all       +
       |   of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms.              +
       |       MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to         +
       |   develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the               +
       |   currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.               +
       |       Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure      +
       |   on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp      +
       |   F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge           +
       |   trade surplus with the U.S.                                          +
       |       "It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S.     +
       |   Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella," Iida     +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic       +
       |   Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in         +
       |   the project when it moves from the research stage, he said.          +
       |       The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support.         +
       |       In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's      +
       |   sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said      +
       |   the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special         +
       |   vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.                             +
       |       As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift        +
       |   the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to                 +
       |   manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to        +
       |   specify which products.                                              +
       |       "By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on         +
       |   your daily products, although this does not mean we will run         +
       |   away from our mainstream business," he said.                         +
       |                                                                        +
       |                                                                        +

  3984 | HUGHES &lt;HT> APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER &lt;BKO>                     +
       |   An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool                              +
       |   Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker               +
       |   International Corp based on revised terms that allow the             +
       |   companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as         +
       |   required by the U.S. Justice Department.                             +
       |        Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of       +
       |   the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how         +
       |   much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on      +
       |   the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.                 +
       |       An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a           +
       |   funding limit.                                                       +
       |       The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2          +
       |   billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through           +
       |   earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed         +
       |   Justice Department consent decree that would have given the          +
       |   companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed             +
       |   business.                                                            +
       |       Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr           +
       |   lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the      +
       |   merger.                                                              +
       |       Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of           +
       |   Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised           +
       |   terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a       +
       |   buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous               +
       |   agreement had proposed a three-month period.                         +
       |       Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would      +
       |   consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month           +
       |   extension to complete the sale.                                      +
       |       He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic      +
       |   drilling bit business.                                               +
       |       The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to                +
       |   voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.                          +
       |       Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be               +
       |   completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost             +
       |   savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial        +
       |   cutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,        +
       |   the name the merged company will take.                               +
       |       Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies           +
       |   should put the company on a profitable course. "We think that        +
       |   in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see        +
       |   something close to breakeven," he said.                              +
       |       In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs       +
       |   on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.                                          +
       |       Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost       +

       |   22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth" for        +
       |   the fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive        +
       |   Officer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.                   +
       |       O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said       +
       |   the food company is "stronger than at any time in its 118-year       +
       |   history."                                                            +
       |       Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55       +

       |   dlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.                          +
       |       O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big          +
       |   brands, new products and services, new geography, internal           +
       |   growth and acquisitions.                                             +
       |       He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in            +
       |   history, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive        +
       |   said a volume falloff in the overall product category "is a          +
       |   concern to us."                                                      +
       |       O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and      +
       |   will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln        +
       |   dlrs.                                                                +
       |       O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to        +
       |   build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture      +
       |   with the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which            +
       |   produces dry baby food cereal.                                       +
       |       He said Heinz-Japan is "making a profit and generating its       +
       |   first substantial dividends," and implementation of a new            +
       |   partnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new             +

       |       To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz             +
       |   implemented a "lowest cost imaginable" program targeted at           +
       |   manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.                  +
       |       He said a modernization program is in effect at the              +

  5473 | ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION                          +
       |   &lt;Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique                             +
       |   among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global            +
       |   expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its           +
       |   yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.       +
       |       First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst         +
       |   Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is      +
       |   attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because         +
       |   ... they're going to have to build an international earnings         +
       |   base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic       +
       |   trust companies," Walsh said.                                        +
       |       Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's         +
       |   154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth          +
       |   this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company           +
       |   profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.                    +
       |       He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26       +
       |   pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.                                   +
       |       Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with          +
       |   assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated            +
       |   internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.             +
       |       Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when          +
       |   other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and            +
       |   loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.                     +
       |       The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened      +
       |   domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank        +
       |   operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,      +
       |   Cornelissen said.                                                    +
       |       Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and         +
       |   Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical       +
       |   Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset      +
       |   management, merchant and private banking companies.                  +
       |       "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of the      +
       |   Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would       +
       |   otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up."                    +
       |       Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct          +
       |   competition with major global financial institutions in              +
       |   activities such as international lending and stock brokerage,        +
       |   in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional      +
       |   trust activities such as asset management, private banking and       +
       |   advisory services.                                                   +
       |       He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations          +
       |   "before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory       +
       |   Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.                 +
       |       "The international market is so big and we have such a           +
       |   miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really           +
       |   limited only by our energy and our desire to find more               +
       |   business," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "we          +
       |   don't think the international markets are well-served."              +
       |       Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign          +
       |   investment interest in North America and increased Canadian          +
       |   investment abroad, Cornelissen said.                                 +
       |       Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid        +
       |   economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said             +
       |   Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion       +
       |   dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.                            +
       |       Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia         +
       |   will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of      +
       |   global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we had        +
       |   to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include       +
       |   offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also          +
       |   recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.              +
       |       The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing         +
       |   growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any      +
       |   acquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have our        +
       |   eyes wide open for the right opportunities."                         +
       |       Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the          +
       |   company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,      +
       |   Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well      +
       |   covered by hundreds of small regional banks.                         +
       |       "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,"          +
       |   said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will            +
       |   probably do something with in the next five years."                  +
       |       He said the company would continue to emphasize its home         +
       |   Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services            +
       |   analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.                   +
       |       Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,         +
       |   trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in       +
       |   one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition         +
       |   for Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.       +
       |                                                                        +
       |                                                                        +

 10347 | WORLD BANK CHIEF URGES MORE JAPANESE INVESTMENT                        +
       |   World Bank President Barber Conable                                  +
       |   called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, for       +
       |   its own sake as well as that of the world economy.                   +
       |       "Japan has the means to make a major contribution to             +
       |   development in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanese          +
       |   businessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additional       +
       |   support."                                                            +
       |       With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan           +
       |   could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries          +
       |   develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.            +
       |       Conable said additional commercial bank investment would         +
       |   also be to Japan's advantage.                                        +
       |       It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus        +
       |   into Third World economies -- notably those in South America,        +
       |   China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those       +
       |   in the developed world, he said.                                     +
       |       Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's        +
       |   concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development       +
       |   Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its         +
       |   contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for        +
       |   Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.                +
       |       Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural         +
       |   adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to      +
       |   open their economies more to free competition and trade.             +
       |       "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank      +
       |   loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conable      +
       |   told Reuters after his speech.                                       +
       |       Such loans currently account for slightly over 20 pct.           +
       |                                                                        +
       |                                                                        +

  5792 | KOBE RUBBER EXCHANGE TO EXTEND TRADING HOURS                           +
       |   The Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will                                +
       |   extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to      +
       |   use the exchange.                                                    +
       |       Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry          +
       |   approval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at          +
       |   1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at the       +
       |   new session the following day before the opening call starts at      +
       |   0930 local time, an Exchange official said.                          +
       |       Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producer         +
       |   price indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active after      +
       |   the end of the current final session here.                           +
       |       The introduction of the new session will enable                  +
       |   participants to trade overnight after taking account of              +
       |   Singapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who are         +
       |   designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume        +
       |   traded overnight to the new final session before the opening         +
       |   session starts next day, the official said.                          +
       |       But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which      +
       |   sets a fixed price at each session, the price of contracts           +
       |   traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth        +
       |   session, he added.                                                   +
       |       Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve      +
       |   the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures              +
       |   industry to expand and internationalise.                             +
       |       The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, which          +
       |   also trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans to         +
       |   introduce an extra session.                                          +
       |       TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day. Four          +
       |   sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions,         +
       |   but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time.           +
       |                                                                        +

 11813 | TAIWAN SEES SHARP DECLINE IN SHIPBREAKING                              +
       |   Taiwan's shipbreaking industry is                                    +
       |   expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986       +
       |   because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the        +
       |   rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products,        +
       |   industry sources said.                                               +
       |       Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344            +
       |   vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt),        +
       |   up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan      +
       |   Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, told             +
       |   Reuters.                                                             +
       |       China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while       +
       |   South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said.                +
       |       Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading           +
       |   shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, "We       +
       |   expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected         +
       |   decline in our steel product exports."                               +
       |       Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in             +
       |   scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the        +
       |   U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel.                  +
       |       Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel           +
       |   product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half      +
       |   of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a       +
       |   Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said.                     +
       |       Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel           +
       |   exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's.           +
       |       The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against        +
       |   the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and              +
       |   economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by      +
       |   the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said.                      +
       |       In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan           +
       |   remained stable during the same period, he added.                    +

  7135 | ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs                            +
       |   The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and                               +
       |   Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and      +
       |   currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,      +
       |   economists said.                                                     +
       |       "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in        +
       |   1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be          +
       |   screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve        +
       |   Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.                            +
       |       Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.       +
       |   after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.          +
       |       Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,       +
       |   the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric          +
       |   against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their      +
       |   currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.         +
       |       The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized             +
       |   countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the      +
       |   currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main       +
       |   focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to      +
       |   close the competiveness gap for American goods.                      +
       |       U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he        +
       |   expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.              +
       |       But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their         +
       |   own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not          +
       |   risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries        +
       |   of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and           +
       |   Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.               +
       |       "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was              +
       |   Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of      +
       |   Lloyds Bank PLC.                                                     +
       |       Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore       +
       |   and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170      +
       |   billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.                 +
       |       The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in      +
       |   1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade            +
       |   deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.       +
       |       And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is          +
       |   continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6             +
       |   billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The        +
       |   gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.        +
       |       Lately both nations have said they will take steps to            +
       |   defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many      +
       |   of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import            +
       |   tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.       +
       |       Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last       +
       |   week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to          +
       |   five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.        +
       |       For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut            +
       |   tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and       +
       |   try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang            +
       |   Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect            +
       |   Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.              +
       |       The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles        +
       |   and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the        +
       |   area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars.               +
       |       Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America       +
       |   -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.            +
       |       "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When       +
       |   their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing       +
       |   base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob         +
       |   Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.         +
       |       The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,      +
       |   72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its                +

       |       A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and       +
       |   South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.           +
       |       While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the       +
       |   U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.       +
       |       But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in        +
       |   marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into       +
       |   large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade       +
       |   and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.                +
       |       Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to         +
       |   18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and           +
       |   Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.            +
       |       Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.               +
       |       "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been       +
       |   at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.       +
       |       February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers          +
       |   exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.         +
       |       But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response          +
       |   from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work         +
       |   with a sizeable lag, economists say.                                 +
       |       The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and        +
       |   Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is         +
       |   pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since              +
       |   September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.        +
       |       But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against        +
       |   the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.        +
       |       "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those          +
       |   countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said           +
       |   Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.                                             +
       |       And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their         +
       |   hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.         +
       |       Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will        +
       |   get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to      +
       |   see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then      +
       |   the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said.            +
       |                                                                        +

  8111 | MALAYSIAN 1987 ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN ABOVE FORECAST                     +
       |   The Development Bank of Singapore Ltd                                +
       |   (DBS) said Malaysia's real gross domestic product growth (gdp)       +
       |   in 1987 could be 1.5 to two pct, above a budget target of one        +
       |   pct.                                                                 +
       |       It said in a report that because of an economic recovery         +
       |   and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is       +
       |   unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.                     +
       |       The report was presented at a two-day investment conference      +
       |   organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks.           +
       |       The report said rising commodity prices and the continued        +
       |   expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous          +
       |   fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for         +
       |   cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.                       +
       |       It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60       +
       |   and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the       +
       |   year.                                                                +
       |       But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external       +
       |   debt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said              +
       |   Malaysia's external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs      +
       |   and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct.                           +

  8119 | MINISTER PREDICTS ONE PCT INFLATION FOR SINGAPORE                      +
       |   Singapore will have an inflation rate                                +
       |   of one pct in 1987, up from a negative 1.4 pct in 1986, Trade        +
       |   and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament.               +
       |       He said the 1986 drop in the inflation rate, the first fall      +
       |   in a decade, was due largely to lower world prices for oil and       +
       |   oil-related items.                                                   +
       |       But Lee said the negative inflation rate is unlikely to be       +
       |   repeated this year because of projected higher prices for            +
       |   primary commodities and oil.                                         +

  8902 | STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BAD-DEBT PROVISIONS                         +
       |   Standard Chartered Plc &lt;STCH.L>, faced                            +
       |   with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and      +
       |   an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its          +
       |   bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.              +
       |       Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that       +
       |   bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,         +
       |   stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.                +
       |       Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in       +
       |   the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax        +
       |   breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while          +
       |   71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.       +
       |       In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for      +
       |   1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total            +
       |   pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.               +
       |       "The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore     +
       |   and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping             +
       |   industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and        +
       |   doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on      +
       |   top of the normal level of provisioning," Barber said.               +
       |       He said, "the decision was also taken to build up loan loss      +
       |   reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for           +
       |   general provisions for commercial and cross border risks."           +
       |       Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific       +
       |   region made "a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits."          +
       |       He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses        +
       |   was "well maintained, although the reported result was affected      +
       |   by cross border debt provisioning," while Californian subsidiary     +
       |   Union Bank "showed continued growth."                                +
       |       "Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in       +
       |   excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued," he      +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a            +
       |   takeover bid by Lloyds Bank &lt;LLOY.L> last year, strengthened      +
       |   its capital resources during that year to just over three            +
       |   billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.           +
       |       Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary        +
       |   capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.              +
       |                                                                        +

       |   International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), but growers and       +
       |   traders are unhappy with the development, according to views         +
       |   polled by Reuter correspondents.                                     +
       |       Officials in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, which             +
       |   produce the bulk of the world's rubber, said they expected the       +
       |   new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber       +
       |   industries remain viable in the long-term.                           +
       |       But traders and growers said they were against the new pact      +
       |   because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere          +
       |   with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.        +
       |       The new INRA, to replace the current one which expires on        +
       |   October 22, was formally adopted by most of the world's              +
       |   producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday.                       +
       |       It will be open for signature at the U.N. Headquarters in        +
       |   New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter          +
       |   into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting       +
       |   for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.      +
       |       Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said         +
       |   the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of             +
       |   liquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber       +
       |   and a possible depression of prices.                                 +
       |       He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to      +
       |   keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose        +
       |   or fell through its buffer stock system.                             +
       |       Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of        +
       |   purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a        +
       |   contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done             +
       |   through direct cash contributions from members, he said.             +
       |       Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to        +
       |   finance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed          +
       |   with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become            +
       |   indebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International        +
       |   Tin Agreement.                                                       +
       |       "This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out      +
       |   without any financial encumbrance," Lim said.                        +
       |        Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking             +
       |   cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers      +
       |   and consumers would also become members, he said.                    +
       |       Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit       +
       |   to Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.              +
       |       It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because       +
       |   its new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.          +
       |       Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new         +
       |   pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt       +
       |   the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market             +
       |   operations.                                                          +
       |        Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free          +
       |   rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at       +
       |   levels that were only acceptable to consumers.                       +
       |       "With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable      +
       |   level, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,      +
       |   while producers may never see sharp price rises," a Malaysian        +
       |   Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters.                        +
       |       Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the           +
       |   overhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had              +
       |   psychologically prevented price rises, he said.                      +
       |       State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had          +
       |   been depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a          +
       |   buffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.                      +
       |       Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was      +
       |   expensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.                    +
       |       Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be           +
       |   pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to       +
       |   stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers      +
       |   to produce more.                                                     +
       |       Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's         +
       |   conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to        +
       |   allow sharp price fluctuations in future.                            +
       |       "The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be             +
       |   liquidated and a free market returned," a Malaysian trader said.     +
       |       Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success      +
       |   as most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they       +
       |   questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers        +
       |   to finance buffer stock operations.                                  +
       |                                                                        +

       |       Bank Negara said although Malaysia's net borrowing dropped       +

       |   of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is             +
       |   pegged.                                                              +

 10593 | NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE                           +
       |   The London Metal Exchange's, LME,                                    +
       |   decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,       +
       |   with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a          +
       |   positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.                +
       |       Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum      +
       |   purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,          +
       |   1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct        +
       |   contract.                                                            +
       |       This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European         +
       |   delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at           +
       |   Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts.                   +
       |       Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with      +
       |   existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt             +
       |   material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.                +
       |       The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive      +
       |   move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and         +
       |   Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to             +
       |   warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.            +
       |       Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler        +
       |   with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost      +
       |   exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be        +
       |   done during the sterling rings, they added.                          +
       |       LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more          +
       |   closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the        +
       |   recent wide backwardations.                                          +
       |       Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct           +
       |   purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc        +
       |   countries, such as Romania.                                          +
       |       The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined       +
       |   as an exporter recently, they said.                                  +
       |       Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from         +
       |   liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to            +
       |   centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where      +
       |   there are many holders of large short positions on the LME.          +
       |       But others said the new contract would soon attract trading      +
       |   interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been               +
       |   attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.                 +
       |       The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a         +
       |   new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where        +
       |   high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they       +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will            +
       |   eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like      +
       |   standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,        +
       |   gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process        +
       |   in this case may take longer, they added.                            +
       |       Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore              +
       |   warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,      +
       |   which make physical trading difficult, would not totally             +
       |   disappear as a result, the trade sources said.                       +
       |       These premiums for prompt metal have become a                    +
       |   semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased          +
       |   business and volatility in traded options, and are presently         +
       |   around 50 stg.                                                       +
       |       Increasingly large granting of option positions has been         +
       |   taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at       +
       |   the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes       +
       |   around these dates are commonplace, they said.                       +
       |       Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern         +
       |   operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of       +
       |   having to cover.                                                     +
       |       But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even       +

       |       UIC is likely to take a controlling stake in the troubled        +
       |   international coffee trading firm, but plans are not finalised       +
       |   and negotiations will continue for another two weeks, he said.       +
       |       Teck Hock's nine creditor banks have agreed to extend the        +
       |   company's loan repayment period for 10 years although a              +

       |       Teck Hock owes more than 100 mln Singapore dlrs and since        +

 11830 | PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING                       +
       |   A proposed sales tax on gold transactions                            +
       |   could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of      +
       |   trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and        +
       |   Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press        +
       |   conference.                                                          +
       |       "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,       +
       |   Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"     +
       |   he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would      +
       |   be unable to compete in the international market, he added.          +
       |       "How can the government really raise taxes if the system         +
       |   they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.         +
       |       The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades       +
       |   exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen      +
       |   tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.       +
       |       The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading       +
       |   more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,         +
       |   gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as         +
       |   that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.                           +
       |       However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and           +
       |   coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.           +
       |       Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold        +
       |   turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.        +
       |       A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early           +
       |   1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks      +
       |   fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.        +
       |       Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the         +
       |   volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.                      +
       |       While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the            +
       |   volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London         +
       |   and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.             +
       |       Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average       +
       |   just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.                            +
       |       Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the       +
       |   government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to          +
       |   commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers       +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese            +
       |   trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign          +
       |   participant.                                                         +
       |       Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one       +
       |   and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while            +
       |   futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers          +
       |   said.                                                                +
       |       "All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo      +
       |   market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three           +
       |   major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal          +
       |   opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper       +
       |   on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"     +
       |   Hofer said.                                                          +
       |       "I don't think it fits the philosophy of an                      +
       |   internationalising market," he added.                                +
       |       Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,              +
       |   attending the press conference, said they supported Credit           +
       |   Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.         +
       |                                                                        +

 11891 | CPC INTERNATIONAL &lt;CPC> TO SELL ASIAN STAKES                        +
       |   CPC International Inc                                                +
       |   said said it has agreed in principle to sell interests in its        +
       |   grocery products operations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the              +
       |   Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand to &lt;Ajinomoto Co      +
       |   Inc> of Japan for 340 mln dlrs.                                      +
       |       The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a       +
       |   substantial part of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt.        +
       |       It said as part of the agreement, its current direct             +
       |   investment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture with       +
       |   Ajinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement for       +
       |   the long-term utilization of technology and trademarks.              +
       |       The company said the change in the Japanese arrangement          +
       |   will give Ajinomoto full equity ownership while leaving CPC a        +
       |   continuing earnings stream and cash flow.                            +
       |       The transactions are subject to definitive agreements and        +
       |   government approvals.                                                +
       |       CPC said not included in the 340 mln dlr consideration are       +
       |   proceeds from the sale of some smaller Asian investments,            +
       |   including a 51 pct equity interest in an oat-based food venture      +
       |   to an Australian partner.                                            +
       |       The company said the actions being taken under its               +
       |   restructuring program, including the sale of its European corn       +
       |   wet milling business and other assets, overhead reductions and       +
       |   other expense items and the Asian transactions, will have a          +
       |   one-time positive effect on 1987 earnings.                           +
       |       CPC said "Although the extent cannot yet be determined, the      +
       |   company expects that 1987 earnings per share will increase by        +
       |   substantially more than the previously estimated 20 pct              +
       |   increase over 1986."  In 1986 CPC earned 2.30 dlrs per share.        +

 12397 | SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH                      +
       |   Singapore's major banks are                                          +
       |   diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from        +
       |   loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.                     +
       |       The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank    +
       |   Ltd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking     +
       |   Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.         +
       |       The shift towards securitisation has been helped by              +
       |   volatile financial markets which have developed hedging              +
       |   facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk            +
       |   management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.        +
       |       Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see        +
       |   limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are             +
       |   switching from term lending to major growth areas such as            +
       |   stockbroking and fee based income, he said.                          +
       |       Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being         +
       |   granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now       +
       |   moving into the new government securities market and the Stock       +
       |   Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.                  +
       |       One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the             +
       |   Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity      +
       |   market in Singapore.                                                 +
       |       Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has        +
       |   increased business transactions and provided long term growth        +
       |   for the market. The banks are not competition for individual         +
       |   stockbroking firms because of the increased business they            +
       |   generate, he added.                                                  +
       |       Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand            +
       |   equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because       +
       |   of the increasing ability of foreign and local market                +
       |   participants to absorb new issues.                                   +
       |       Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of     +
       |   the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to       +
       |   launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors        +
       |   seeking capital growth through a diversified international           +
       |   portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the           +
       |   emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.                      +
       |       &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the       +
       |   Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong          +
       |   Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.              +
       |       Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in          +
       |   Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be        +
       |   forced to provide fund management services for major clients         +
       |   seeking better returns, he said.                                     +
       |       Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major           +
       |   banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from        +
       |   treasury and investment banking activities.                          +
       |       They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese        +
       |   and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct       +
       |   against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.              +
       |       Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40         +
       |   mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.               +
       |       The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in        +
       |   1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by               +
       |   &lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary     +
       |   of the bank, they said.                                              +

       |       The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar      +

       |   third largest after West Germany and Japan.                          +

       |   about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987.        +

       |       Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last                      +

       |       The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles                       +

       |       While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the                      +
       |   U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.                      +
       |       But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in                       +
       |   marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into                      +
       |   large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade                      +
       |   and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.                               +
       |       Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to                        +

       |       Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.                              +
       |       "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been                      +
       |   at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.                      +
       |       February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers                         +
       |   exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.                        +
       |       But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response                         +
       |   from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work                        +
       |   with a sizeable lag, economists say.                                                +
       |       The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and                       +
       |   Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is                        +
       |   pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since                             +
       |   September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.                       +
       |       But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against                       +
       |   the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.                       +
       |       "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those                         +

       |       And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their                        +
       |   hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.                        +
       |       Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will                       +
       |   get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to                     +

 11830 | PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING                                      +
       |   A proposed sales tax on gold transactions                                           +
       |   could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of                     +
       |   trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and                       +
       |   Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press                       +
       |   conference.                                                                         +
       |       "If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,                      +
       |   Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"                    +
       |   he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would                     +
       |   be unable to compete in the international market, he added.                         +
       |       "How can the government really raise taxes if the system                        +
       |   they impose is prohibitive of generating business?" he said.                        +
       |       The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades                      +
       |   exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen                     +
       |   tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.                      +
       |       The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading                      +
       |   more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,                        +
       |   gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as                        +
       |   that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.                                          +
       |       However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and                          +
       |   coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.                          +
       |       Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold                       +
       |   turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.                       +
       |       A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early                          +
       |   1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks                     +
       |   fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.                       +
       |       Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the                        +
       |   volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.                                     +
       |       While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the                           +
       |   volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London                        +
       |   and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.                            +
       |       Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average                      +
       |   just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.                                           +
       |       Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the                      +

   925 | CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.                                           +
       |   China called on the United States to                                                +
       |   remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading                          +
       |   status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.                         +
       |       But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing                       +
       |   13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are                     +
       |   inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade                            +
       |   Congress to change laws which limit its exports.                                    +
       |        The official International Business newspaper today                            +
       |   published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the                      +
       |   visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.                                     +
       |        "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its                     +
       |   restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities                      +
       |   for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese                     +
       |   exports," the editorial said.                                                       +
       |        "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against                         +
       |   favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China                       +
       |   into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).                                    +
       |        "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in                         +
       |   recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and                         +
       |   influences normal trade between the two countries," it added                        +
       |        The paper also printed an article by China's commercial                        +
       |   counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said                        +
       |   that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing                   +
       |   bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.                                      +
       |        He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on                        +
       |   technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.                              +
       |        The paper also printed a table showing that, since                             +
       |   bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every                        +
       |   year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits                      +
       |   at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.                                             +
       |        A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept                           +
       |   Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude                          +
       |   goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While                     +
       |   U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.                                        +
       |        He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will                     +
       |   have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several                       +
       |   laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.                            +
       |        The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,                       +
       |   China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and                      +
       |   Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be                        +
       |   dominated or controlled by international Communism."                                +
       |        The official said China was well aware of the laws, some                       +
       |   of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that                          +
       |   there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change                        +
       |   them.                                                                               +
       |        China has been the subject of about a dozen cases                              +
       |   involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,                       +
       |   which the U.S. Side won, he said.                                                   +
       |        But, for the first time, China signed last week an                             +
       |   agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain                         +
       |   exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may                        +
       |   lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.                     +
       |        Another diplomat said willingness to provide such                              +
       |   voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in                          +
       |   bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.                         +
       |        "China has the potential to disrupt world markets,                             +
       |   especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous                        +
       |   about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other                     +
       |   centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.                           +
       |        Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of                     +
       |   GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports                      +
       |   or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.                                   +
       |        In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.                        +
       |   Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed                          +
       |   China's interest in participating in GATT.                                          +
       |        "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished                     +
       |   overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large                           +
       |   economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.                                          +
       |        "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT                     +
       |   discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and                     +
       |   enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further                      +
       |   develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum                          +
       |   benefit from its GATT participation," he said.                                      +
       |        The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership                       +
       |   are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen                      +
       |   regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially                     +
       |   for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.                                   +
       |        In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT                      +
       |   last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic                      +
       |   system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance                           +

       |        The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to                        +

       |       Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in                      +
       |   the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said                         +
       |   they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.                                    +
       |       A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much                       +

       |   result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive                       +

       |       The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is                        +
       |   likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.                       +
       |       A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the                     +

       |       The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house                        +
       |   said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.                     +
       |       "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China,                    +
       |   which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go                     +
       |   elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," he                         +
       |   said.                                                                               +
       |       The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is                       +
       |   in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital                     +
       |   markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.                                  +

       |       "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other                        +
       |   areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable                         +
       |   autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to                            +
       |   exercise indirect controls," he said.                                               +
       |       The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the                     +
       |   past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be                           +
       |   affected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase                        +

       |   advance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.                        +
       |       The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Things                      +
       |   are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in                       +

       |   said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more                        +
       |   than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier                         +

       |   export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and                     +

       |   management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six                       +

  9793 | IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED                                       +
       |   Efforts by governments to control wheat                                             +
       |   surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial                      +
       |   success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its                          +
       |   latest monthly report.                                                              +
       |       Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing                        +
       |   both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC                     +
       |   says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat                           +
       |   exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.                       +
       |       In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,                         +
       |   which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export                            +
       |   income, there may be problems in reducing production.                               +
       |       A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to                              +
       |   unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.                       +
       |   Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then                       +
       |   lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.                       +
       |       The IWC outlines three courses of action open to                                +
       |   governments in wheat exporting countries.                                           +
       |       They could continue to support prices in the hope that when                     +
       |   the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and                           +
       |   surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.                                             +
       |       Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which                          +
       |   could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long                       +
       |   period.                                                                             +
       |       This option may prove to be the most politically                                +
       |   unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning                          +
       |   wheat production, the report said.                                                  +
       |       The third option would be for governments to distinguish                        +
       |   between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,                           +
       |   possibly varying support prices according to farm size or                           +
       |   overall production.                                                                 +
       |       The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting                     +
       |   countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the                       +
       |   producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.                      +
       |       These changes did not always result in lower export                             +
       |   subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more                        +
       |   than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.                                  +
       |       For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention                     +
       |   price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European                           +
       |   currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which                       +
       |   most export transactions are denominated, the intervention                          +
       |   price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of                           +
       |   supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers                      +
       |   and some governments are now searching for ways to cut                              +
       |   expenditure, the report says.                                                       +
       |       The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five                       +
       |   major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey                        +
       |   from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to                       +
       |   increased production in China and India.                                            +
       |       The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was                     +
       |   countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower                         +
       |   acreages.                                                                           +

       |   Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to                             +
       |   objections from foreign businessmen and others.                                     +
       |       But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government                          +
       |   still considered FECs unsatisfactory.                                               +

       |   raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and                      +
       |   added: "It is rather complicated."                                                  +
       |       The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in                       +
       |   China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and                      +
       |   there is a big black market in the currency, though it is                           +

       |       Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had                     +
       |   "many demerits and negative influences."                                            +

       |       An official of the Shanghai city government said county                         +
       |   authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of                        +
       |   arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must                       +
       |   be approved by the city government.                                                 +
       |      The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its                        +
       |   efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The                       +
       |   prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making                      +
       |   it more profitable for them to grow other crops.                                    +
       |       To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser                       +
       |   and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to                     +
       |   buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to                         +
       |   China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise                      +
       |   grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.                                    +
       |       Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the                          +
       |   problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.                          +
       |       Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the                      +
       |   eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too                      +
       |   much to the demands of "selfish city people" and could raise city                   +
       |   grain prices without any problem.                                                   +
       |       But the government has ruled out a price rise. "Raising the                     +
       |   price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social                      +
       |   stability," said a China Daily editorial this month.                                +
       |       The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the                     +
       |   long term. "We must be very careful. We have a very large                           +
       |   population which is used to price stability and will object to                      +
       |   price rises," he said. "The problem is how to do it."                               +
       |       The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might                         +
       |   also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with                       +
       |   grain and consumed by city residents.                                               +
       |       In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate                          +
       |   investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.                           +
       |       The official press has reported that farmers fear farm                          +
       |   policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into                        +

       |   contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,                      +
       |   but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.                        +
       |       "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at                    +
       |   the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the                          +
       |   future," the China Daily said in an editorial last month.                           +
       |       Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to                     +

       |   embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds                         +
       |   that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices                      +

       |       The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives                       +
       |   here is that a general warming of relations between the two                         +
       |   countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times                     +
       |   in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.                                +
       |       In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider                       +
       |   buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.                             +

       |       Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and                         +

       |   decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not                     +
       |   only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.                        +
       |       Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to                            +
       |   include only the Soviets.                                                           +

       |   in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to                        +
       |   boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not                      +
       |   be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates                          +

       |       Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen                       +

       |   market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which                      +
       |   has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.                             +
       |       A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the                     +
       |   difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still                          +
       |   remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is                       +

       |       The increasing cases of record production as a result of                        +
       |   record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers                      +

       |       As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of                     +
       |   production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to                           +
       |   prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.                       +
       |       Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and                     +
       |   sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the                     +
       |   level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully                         +
       |   compensate producers when exporting on the world market.                            +

       |   pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to                        +
       |   this growth was the successful introduction of new products,                        +

       |   and the lowest price since August, 1981.                       +
       |        Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee+
       |   Organization failed in February to reach an agreement          +
       |   controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed   +
       |   this week as the executive board of the organization met in    +
       |   London without reopening debate on its export quotas.          +
       |       The executive board has limited its current discussions to +
       |   administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.          +
       |       Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 +
       |   dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions  +
       |   aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.             +
       |       Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson    +
       |   Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high     +
       |   point for the year because most producing nations have just    +
       |   completed their harvests.                                      +
       |       In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with+
       |   serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.         +
       |       "This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to     +
       |   undertake sales despite the drop in prices," she said.         +
       |       Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the +
       |   period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall   +
       |   another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said.                 +

       |   about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar    +
       |   discouraged new buying.                                        +
       |       "The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know   +
       |   which way to go," one analyst said.                            +
       |       Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile  +
       |   Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen +
       |   pork bellies finished sharply lower.                           +
       |       Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter    +
       |   storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in+
       |   snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition.         +
       |       Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture          +
       |   Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their      +
       |   breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter.     +
       |   Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices.         +
       |       Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater+
       |   production and closed with limit losses.                       +
       |       Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of +
       |   Trade, while corn and wheat were lower.                        +
       |       Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that +
       |   farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from    +
       |   61.5 mln planted last year.                                    +
       |       Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln     +
       |   acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres,  +
       |   but was larger than analysts expected.                         +
